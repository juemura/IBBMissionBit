<h1>To start your server:</h1>

<b>1. open your terminal</b>

    command + spacebar
    type in 'terminal'
    select the terminal

<b>2. 'cd' into the file that your game is located in.</b>

    ex. if your game folder is on your desktop you will first cd into Desktop, then cd into the name of your game folder

    hint: if you don't know where you are in your computer, type 'ls' to list the folders that you have available to you

    hint: if you mess up your terminal, or go into the wrong folder:
        'cd' to go all the way back to the beginning

<b>3. When you get into the correct folder, start your server by typing:</b>
    
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

<b>4. You will see "Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ..." on the next line</b>

    hint: if you don't get this, you had a typo. Go back and retype the command in Step 3

<b>5. Go to Google Chrome, type in:</b>

    localhost:8000

<b>6. Your game should show up. </b>
    
    hint: If you started your server inside of a folder that another folder is located, you will see a list of folders inside of that folder. Just select the game folder and your game should appear.

<b>7. When you are done with your server, close it</b>
